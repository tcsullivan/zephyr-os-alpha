# zephyr
VEX project for team 5106Z

An attempt to create our own system for the robot.

    * Based off of the latest ChibiOS
    * In C++ because we're cool
    * Final output extremely small because we haven't implemented that much
    * Probably really fast/efficient

As of 11/11 this OS (?) can:
    * write digital pins and set their mode
    * write text and numbers to the lcd
    * set motors 2-9
    * read the joysticks
    * read battery levels

# kinda important
If you actually plan to use this... don't. Not yet.

It can't even work with a competition switch.
